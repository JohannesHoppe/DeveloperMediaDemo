## 1. Introduction

In the last [webinar](http://bit.ly/devMediaCode) we were introduced to Knockout.js and the ASP.NET Web API as well as REST principles. We continuously used a JavaScript library called "jQuery". During the recent webinars nobody asked for an explanation of the jQuery code. This was no surprise, since Query is the most popular JavaScript library on the market. Chances are very high that you have already seen jQuery in the wild, too. In most of my projects I have seen jQuery as a standard for DOM manipulation and AJAX handling. These use cases are inbuilt since the very early beginning of jQuery. Due to the fact that everything works smoothly and that API stayed compatible for most of the cases, a lot of people do not really care about the progress that the framework has made since the early days. Let's start with an introduction for jQuery newcomers and continue with some parts that have changed during the versions.

### 2.1. Basics

This plain JavaScript snippet manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) a bit by adding a background color and some padding to all &lt;div&gt; elements:

```html
<div class="postit">
    <h2>Hello World</h2>
</div>        

<script> 
    var divs = document.getElementsByClassName('postit');

    for (i = 0; i < divs.length; i++) {
        divs[i].style.backgroundColor = '#F0F0A6';
        divs[i].style.padding = '10px';
    }
</script>
```

During development you want to concentrate on solving tasks instead of writing boilerplate code. But hey, at least it works, doesn't it? Soon we would find out that there are numerous compatibility issues across different browsers. This snippet for example doesn't works in until IE9!

([reference](http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html)) 

We must add this extra bits of code to get the expected result in IE8 (older version will still struggle):

```javascript
if(!document.getElementsByClassName) {
    document.getElementsByClassName = function(className) {
        return this.querySelectorAll("." + className);
    };
    Element.prototype.getElementsByClassName = document.getElementsByClassName;
}
```

A great book is ["jQuery in Action"](http://www.manning.com/bibeault2/). It goes into details where other books still cover boring topics!
