## 1. Introduction

In the last [jQuery webinar](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/05.%20jQuery%20Webinar.md) we had a closer look on jQuery core. It's time to review the jQuery plugins as well as the jQuery ecosystem. There are numerous frameworks that add missing features to jQuery (e.g. Knockout adds MVVM support) or that are build on top of it. (e.g. Bootstrap and Kendo UI). To make things more interesting, we will concentrate on mobile apps.

## 3. Mobile apps

JQuery is a fresh and modern framework. A good proof is the support of many mobile scenarios. Usually a mobile app belongs to one of these tree groups:

1. Native apps
2. Mobile optimized Websites
3. Hybrid apps

**Native apps** are built for a specific platform with the official platform SDK. Its important to know the specific development languages: Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android and C# for Windows Phone. The are published and sold via the official app store. Usually App stores are the most profitable distribution channel for publishers. On the one hand a closed app system guarantees revenue, but on the other hand it's hard to target different operation systems since specialized developers are required. Due to that fact, for most apps only the two big players (iOS and Android) are targeted.

**Mobile optimized websites** are just normal server-side apps, built with any server-side technology that renders HTML. The biggest challenges are the styling (it must feel "native" and must fit the the device form factor) and the fact, that a mobile device can be go offline or struggle with a limited connectivity. On the one hand its hard to monetize such an app, but on the other hand its easier to target various platform with the same team of developers, that can be specialized to any server-side programming language and framework.

**Hybrid apps** try to close the gap between both worlds. They are written with web technologies (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and do not require specialized knowledge about the targeted platform and its tools. Hybrid apps are shipped with a native executable that provides a browser engine for the web stack as well as an abstraction layer that allows access of native libraries. This abstraction layer is presented as an JavaScript API. The browser engine (and the general performance JavaScript) as well as the amount of abstraction make hybrid apps slower in comparison to native apps. Having that in mind, hybrid platforms offer a suitable way to build apps with open standards that can be published to the app stores!

The most common framework for hybrid apps is [Apache Cordova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova). The framework was originally called [PhonGap](http://phonegap.com/) until Adobe made it open source. Now PhoneGap is the name of the most common open source distribution of Cordova with an own app directory. However, as an windows user it is difficulty to create an iOS app. PhoneGap requires you to own a Mac, since tools required for building iOS applications run only on the OS X operating system. To avoid all platform specific struggles, Johannes will show all examples in [Icenium Mist](http://www.icenium.com/). This cloud-based IDE from Telerik a new rising star in the hybrid app world.

<a name="knockout"/>
## 3.1 Knockout based App with Bootstrap

We have already revisited the [MVVM framework](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvvm) Knockout in the [first](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/01.%20Knockout%20Webinar.md) and [second webinar](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/02.%20Knockout%20Webinar.md). Lets continue with the already well-known "sticky notes" example. The demo **"CordovaBootstrapKnockoutDemo"** utilizes jQuery for data retrieval and iterates through the retrieved data with the help of [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/). A plain white HTML5 application has not attractive appearance. The front-end framework [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a great way to change this. It ships with a set of CSS classes (like `container`, `glyphicon`, `alert`, `list-group` or `badge`)  that can be used to style our hybrid application. Themes, like the [Bootswatch Slate theme](http://bootswatch.com/slate/), create a native app appearance. Here is an example where both the Bootstrap CSS classes as well as the Knockout **HTML 5 data-attributes** (`data-bind` with `click`, `foreach` or `text`) are used to show a list of notes:

```html
<div id="index_template" class="container">
    <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-home" data-bind="click: $root.loadData"></i>
    <h2>Bootstrap-Ko</h2>
    
    <p class="alert alert-info">
        The following list was rendered with <b>jQuery</b> &amp; <b>Knockout</b>
        and styled via the Slate <b>Bootstrap</b> theme.
    </p> 
    
    <div class="list-group" data-bind="foreach: notes">
        <a class="list-group-item" data-bind="click: $root.showDetails">
            <span class="badge" data-bind="text: moment(Added()).format('DD.MM.YYYY')"></span>
            <!--ko text: Title--><!--/ko-->
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```

Bootstrap comes with a lot of interesting CSS tricks. For example a special font ("[glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/)") is used to create scalable icons. That font contains icons instead of letters. A good font looks sharp on all devices, so that higher pixel ratios of "retina displays" do not have any negative impact. This technique is called **[icon fonts](http://weloveiconfonts.com/)**, too.

<a name="jQM"/>
## 3.2 jQuery Mobile based App

As we have seen, Bootstrap has "mobile first" responsive grid and a appealing flat graphical style. But it is still designed to work on mobile engines as well as in normal browsers. JQuery mobile (often abbreviated as **jQM**) goes on step further and concentrates on mobile scenarios only. As the name suggests, it is a framework on top of jQuery. While Bootstrap does its (black) magic with CSS tricks, jQuery mobile is overcoming HTML5 limitations with a JavaScript. For example a button is transformed from this:

```html
<button type="submit">Go</button>
```
to this:
```html
<div class="ui-btn ui-btn-inline ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-up-c">
  <span class="ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all">
    <span class="ui-btn-text">Go</span>
  </span>
  <input class="ui-btn-hidden" type="button" value="Go" />
</div>
```
On the one hand all these enhancement hide a lot of problems to the developer, on the other hand it is a bit trickier to enrich jQM apps with a MVVM framework, as [explained here](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2013/04/08/comparing-kendoui-and-knockout-with-a-bit-of-jquerymobile-on-the-side.html#dom). Due to that reason, it is wise to concentrate on jQuery core and jQuery plugins only.

jQM is touch-optimized, themable and ships with a larger collection of [widgets](http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/widgets/). In contrast to the "normal" jQuery way, jQuery mobile is not concentrating on particular DOM elements. It is seeing the page as a whole and enhances all found elements. jQuery Mobile automatically applies many markup enhancements as soon as it loads. These enhancements are applied based on jQuery Mobile's default settings, which are designed to work with common scenarios. Too hook into this process, [read more in the documentation about the `mobileinit` event](http://api.jquerymobile.com/global-config/). This transformation can be steered by **HTML5 data attributes**. The following snipped will render a page with three areas (a header, content and content area).

```html
<div data-role="page">
	<div data-role="header">
		<h1>Title</h1>
	</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<p>Page content.</p>
		</div>
	
	<div data-role="footer">
		Page Footer
	</div>
</div>
```

## 3.3 Kendo UI Mobile based App

In my opinion the golden mean between a pure CSS-based framework (like Bootstrap) combined    
In contrast to jQuery, with Kendo when you create a button:
