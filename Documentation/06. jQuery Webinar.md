## 1. Introduction

In the last [jQuery webinar](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/05.%20jQuery%20Webinar.md) we had a closer look on jQuery core. It's time to review the jQuery plugins as well as the jQuery ecosystem. There are numerous frameworks that add missing features to jQuery (e.g. Knockout adds MVVM support) or that are build on top of it. (e.g. Bootstrap and Kendo UI). To make things more interesting, we will concentrate on mobile apps.

## 3. Mobile apps

JQuery is a fresh and modern framework. A good proof is the support of many mobile scenarios. Usually a mobile app belongs to one of these tree groups:

1. Native apps
2. Mobile optimized Websites
3. Hybrid apps

**Native apps** are built for a specific platform with the official platform SDK. Its important to know the specific development languages: Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android and C# for Windows Phone. The are published and sold via the official app store. Usually App stores are the most profitable distribution channel for publishers. On the one hand a closed app system guarantees revenue, but on the other hand it's hard to target different operation systems since specialized developers are required. Due to that fact, for most apps only the two big players (iOS and Android) are targeted.

**Mobile optimized websites** are just normal server-side apps, built with any server-side technology that renders HTML. The biggest challenges are the styling (it must feel "native" and must fit the the device form factor) and the fact, that a mobile device can be go offline or struggle with a limited connectivity. On the one hand its hard to monetize such an app, but on the other hand its easier to target various platform with the same team of developers, that can be specialized to any server-side programming language and framework.

**Hybrid apps** try to close the gap between both worlds. They are written with web technologies (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and do not require specialized knowledge about the targeted platform and its tools. Hybrid apps are shipped with a native executable that provides a browser engine for the web stack as well as an abstraction layer that allows access of native libraries. This abstraction layer is presented as an JavaScript API. The browser engine (and the general performance JavaScript) as well as the amount of abstraction make hybrid apps slower in comparison to native apps. Having that in mind, hybrid platforms offer a suitable way to build apps with open standards that can be published to the app stores!

The most common framework for hybrid apps is [Apache Cordova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova). The framework was originally called [PhonGap](http://phonegap.com/) until Adobe made it open source. Now PhoneGap is the name of the most common open source distribution of Cordova with an own app directory. However, as an windows user it is difficulty to create an iOS app. PhoneGap requires you to own a Mac, since tools required for building iOS applications run only on the OS X operating system. To avoid all platform specific struggles, Johannes will show all examples in [Icenium Mist](http://www.icenium.com/). This cloud-based IDE from Telerik a new rising star in the hybrid app world.

## 3.1 Knockout based App

We have already revisited Knockout in the [first](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/01.%20Knockout%20Webinar.md) and [second webinar](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/Documentation/02.%20Knockout%20Webinar.md). Lets start with an the well-known "sticky notes" example application. This applications works renders the notes list with Knockout and utilizes jQuery for data retrieval.

## 4. More 

There are several more things to discover.
You should start by downloading the sources of the demo app.  

**Will be published after the presentation.**
