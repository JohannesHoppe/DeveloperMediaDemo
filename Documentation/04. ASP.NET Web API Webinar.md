## 1. Introduction to REST

In the last [Webinar](http://bit.ly/devMediaCode) we were introduced to the ASP.NET Web API from Microsoft. This framework is a toolbox that helps us to create RESTful application interfaces. We were able to offer CRUD operations an a simple resource (which represented some sticky notes), but until not we did not investigated time in the general ideas behind REST at all. It's time to change this.

Roy Fielding is one of the authors of [RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html). In his [PhD thesis (2000)](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) he generalized the Web’s architectural principles and presented them as an architectural style, called REST (Representational State Transfer). His research about distributed application architectures and especially the chapter about REST explains the success of the web due to [client-server architecture](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_2), [statelessness](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_3), [cacheability](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_4) or [layered systems](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_6). Well known building-blocks like [resources and resource identifiers (URI)](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1) or [representations](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_2) should be used. However, due to its academic standard, it is very hard to build an valuable API just with the help of the thesis paper.

In theory REST principles could be applied many protocols. In practice, REST is directly related to the web as we know it with its main protocol HTTP. To make things easier, Leonard Richardson proposed a classification for services on the web. Leonard’s model suggest three levels of service maturity based on a the support for URIs, HTTP, and hypermedia.

## 2. Richardson Maturity Model and ASP.NET Web API
      
The [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps.
