## 1. Introduction to REST

In the last [webinar](http://bit.ly/devMediaCode) we were introduced to the ASP.NET Web API from Microsoft. This framework is a toolbox that helps us to create RESTful application interfaces. We were able to offer CRUD operations an a simple resource (which represented some sticky notes), but until not we did not investigated time in the general ideas behind REST at all. It's time to change this!

Roy Fielding is one of the authors of [RFC 2616 (from 1999)](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html). In his [PhD thesis (from 2000)](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm) he generalized the Web’s architectural principles and presented them as an architectural style, called REST (Representational State Transfer). His research about distributed application architectures and especially the chapter about REST explains the success of the web due to [client-server architecture](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_2), [statelessness](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_3), [cacheability](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_4) or [layered systems](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_1_6). Well known building-blocks like [resources and resource identifiers (URI)](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_1) or [representations](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm#sec_5_2_1_2) should be used. However, due to its academic standard, it is very hard to build an valuable API just with the help of the thesis paper. REST was long forgotten, but frameworks like Ruby on Rails made it public to a wider audience.

In theory REST principles could be applied many protocols. In practice, REST is directly related to the web as we know it with its main protocol HTTP. To make things easier, Leonard Richardson proposed a classification for services on the web. Leonard’s model suggest three levels of service maturity based on the support for URIs, HTTP, and hypermedia.

## 2. Richardson Maturity Model and Microsoft technologies
      
The [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) breaks down the principal elements of a REST approach into three steps.

### 2.1 Level Zero Services 

Services of that level have a single URI and usually all requests are POST'ed to it. The old ASP.NET web services (*.asmx) or  **Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)** web services fall into that category. Client and server are usually tightly coupled to each other. Both parties must match exactly to each other. The most common protocol is [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) which uses HTTP as a tunnel. The tight coupling mustn't be a disadvantage, since a [WSDL file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language) can describe such an API very well. However these remote procedure calls (RPC) have nothing to do with REST and are (in the authors opinion) hard to implement between different platforms.

### 2.2 Level One Services: Resources

The first REST level offers many URIs but only a single HTTP verb (HTTP verb == HTTP method). Due to the lack of verbs APIs of that level tend to have numerous URIs to call. It is very easy to build such an API with plain **ASP.NET MVC** actions that return JSON. Resources are usually build with a questions mark in it, where GET-parameters are used, eg. `GET /Home/GetAllNotes?limit=200&search=test` or `GET /Home/DeleteNote?id=22`. Level one services are very hard to explore and require a very well written documentation.

### 2.3 Level Two Services: Verbs

Level two services host numerous resources (identified via URIs) which offer several HTTP verbs. By definition HTTP GET is a safe operation while verbs like PUT, POST or delete are unsafe operations meant to change the resources state. Level two services should also use HTTP status codes to coordinate interactions. Without any further work, the typical **ASP.NET Web API** controller with its CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) lives at level two.

### 2.4 Problems at Level Two

As long as four methods (CRUD) are really enough, the default ASP.NET Web API plays very well. But for our stick note example: how should we architect a simple "deactivate" operation?

#### 2.4.1 Simple Solution - URI
We could switch back to level one and build special URIs for special operations. Developers of a client will have to know in advance, in which situation those URI should be called. A well written documentation is required, but the approach works and is widely used.

#### 2.4.2 Dirty Solution - POST

We could enhance the POSTed data with a new property. Instead of sending:
```javascript
{
  "Title": "Note 1",
  "Description": "A long text"
}
```
we could hack this into our data:
```javascript
{
  "Title": "Note 1",
  "Description": "A long text",
  "IsActive": false
}
```
Hell will freeze if we are designing an API in that fashion. This approach opens the door we countless pitfalls, eg. data loss or data inconsistency, wrong operations (eg. are we allowed to deactivate the resource by setting the value?) and very tight coupling. The deactivate operation is mixed within the data, so the client developers have to know everything about deactivation and the server developers have to reverse-engineer the lost intent from the given data! You should read more about this [Data/Actions Impedance Mismatch](http://shishkin.org/blog/data-actions-impedance-mismatch/) in Sergey Shishkins blogpost.

#### 2.4.3 Better Solution - PATCH         

[RFC 5789](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) introduces a new verb that reduces the problems. A PATCH request changes just a part of the data of a resource. A [PATCH in JSON format (draft!)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-patch-10) could look like this:

```javascript
{
  {"replace": "/IsActive", "value": false}
}
```
You can learn [more about PATCH in this blog post](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2012/09/05/patch) from Mark Nottingham. However, PATCH was not intended to mask operations. We are still facing the data/actions impedance mismatch.

### 2.5 Level Three Services: Hypermedia

As we have seen, we need a new communication direction. Until now, the client was forced to know everything about the data and the operations that are available. A better approach would an API where the server tells the client which data and operations he wants to offer the the client. This approach leads to he most web-aware level of service supports: the notion of **hypermedia as the engine of application state** (HATEOAS). In that level resources contain URI links to other resources that might be of interest for the next action. HTML offers all required controls (such as links &lt;a&gt; or lists &lt;ul&gt;) but it was designed to present data and operations to humans, not machines. At the moment there is no (final) standard which defines an definite set of hypermedia controls, that are designed to be consumed by machines.

REST-developers can decide to use [JSON-Home Documents](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-03), as described in a draft by Mark Nottingham. JSON-Home documents offer a starting point for a machine that wants to follow a trail of resources. To navigate through the trails we could use one of these formats:

* [Collection+JSON ](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/)  
* [Hypertext Application Language (HAL)](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)

Several other formats are addressing more specialized tasks. In example the ASP.NET Web API supports [**OData**](http://www.odata.org/) to query and manipulate big sets of data in a standardized way. On the Web API site, the result must be of have a type of **IQueryable&lt;T&gt;** to let the magic begin (that's very cool).
