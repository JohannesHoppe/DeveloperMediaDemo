# Knockout Webinar - Documentation

## Introduction

This ASP.NET MVC Prototype demonstrates the usage of some frameworks, which are considered as best-practice within the community.
Basic functionality can be solved via [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, but sophisticated solutions will demand solutions that leverage the MVVM pattern to ASP.NET MVC.

One possible framework is [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/), since it is widely accepted and already build into the standard ASP.NET Web API template from Visual Studio.

Global JavaScript code should be avoided; therefore we need a framework that helps us to write modular JavaScript.
The most used solution is [require.js](http://requirejs.org/). It is script loader that uses the AMD module format.

In the JavaScript world the JSON format is used to exchange data.
In earlier versions of ASP.NET MVC the standard controllers hat to be used to receive and return JSON.
With the introduction of the [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) the overall amount of work to handle JSON in a RESTful way was highly simplified.

## Just Plain HTML

One of the biggest advantages of Knockout is the ability to directly use HTML elements.
No ASP.NET user controls or heavy-loaded vendor-specific controls are required. Just good-old plain HTML:

```html
<div id="index_template">

    <h1>Header</h1>  

    <div>
        
        <div class="drop_shadow postit">
        
            <h2>Title</h2>
            <p>class="message">Message</p>

        </div> 
    </div>    
</div>
```

Together with some stylesheets this results in a bare website:

## Sections and Require.js

For our JavaScript logic we need a starting point. We could start with same nasty inline &lt;script&gt; right next to our previous HTML.
But first of all we will use a Razor @section, which can be rendered in an arbitrary location using the RenderSection method

```javascript
@section scripts {
    alert("hello world");
}
```

It is considered as best-practice to place such a script section in [at the bottom of a page](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom).
But just adding some hacky JavaScript at the bottom of the page won't make things that much better.
That’s why we will define our dependencies with require.js.

Let's start with a snipped that loads the module "indexPage", which would be usually located in a file with the same name and the .js file ending.

```javascript
@section scripts {
    require(['indexPage'], function(i) { 
        i.init(); 
    });
}
```

Here we load the module "indexPage" and decide to name the corresponding param-eter in the anonymous function to a shorter version "i".
We then call the method "init" of the "indexPage" module.
In a perfect world this would be complete setup.
But often we have to deal with version numbers in files, obscured paths or files that don’t implement the AMD pattern.
For all these proposes require.js can be configured.
It’s a good idea to put that configuration into a new file, e.g. called [require.config.js](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/DeveloperMediaDemo/blob/master/DeveloperMediaDemo/DeveloperMediaDemo/Scripts/require.config.js):

```javascript
requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: "Scripts",
    paths: {
        'jquery': 'jquery-1.9.1',
        'knockout': 'knockout-2.2.1'
    },
    shim: {
        'knockout': { deps: ['jquery'] }
    }
});
```

Here we define paths and file names if the file does not match the convention.
There is also a "shim" defined, that indicates that the module "knockout" is dependent upon "jquery".
Require.js will make sure, that jQuery will be loaded before Knockout.
Shims are also often used to point to a global variable that and AMD-ingorand script will create. (via [exports](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config-shim))


## Bootstrap Knockout

A typical MVVM driven-website has three team players:

1. The model, which usually represents some business data and business logic. In our case the model "lives" in the C# world on the server side. Subsets of the data can be serialized to JSON and will be sent over the wire with the help of the ASP.NET Web API.
2. The view, it is built with plain HTML and some extra HTML5 data attributes that help Knockout to do its job.
3. The ViewModel, which glues everything together. The ViewModel is responsible for talking into both "worlds". It represents a chuck of the model data, eg. one prod-uct or a paged list of products. This data can be bound to the HTML so that the data gets visible. The ViewModel also exposed all methods that the view should call to operate on the model / business data.

The already introduced "indexPage" module will be very short. It will create a new ViewModel and apply it to the HTML.
