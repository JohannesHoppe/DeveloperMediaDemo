# Knockout Webinar - Documentation

## Introduction

This ASP.NET MVC Prototype demonstrates the usage of some frameworks, which are considered as best-practice within the community.
Basic functionality can be solved via [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugins, but sophisticated solutions will demand solutions that leverage the MVVM pattern to ASP.NET MVC.

One possible framework is [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/), since it is widely accepted and already build into the standard ASP.NET Web API template from Visual Studio.

Global JavaScript code should be avoided; therefore we need a framework that helps us to write modular JavaScript.
The most used solution is [require.js](http://requirejs.org/). It is script loader that uses the AMD module format.

In the JavaScript world the JSON format is used to exchange data.
In earlier versions of ASP.NET MVC the standard controllers hat to be used to receive and return JSON.
With the introduction of the [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) the overall amount of work to handle JSON in a RESTful way was highly simplified.
